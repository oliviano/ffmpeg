# FFMPEG SCRIPTS

A simple repo for a couple of handy ffmpeg batch script and commands


## [Script_ffmpeg-Floor_TodayEncode.bat]

Batch file that will encode to hapQ based on today date filename
Change infolder / outfolder to suit.

-> depending on the region settings on your system, you may need to swap the order of the argument `set myDate=%%a%%b%%c` to match the filename structure. 


## [ffmpeg-command.bat]

example of the command used to make a hapQ file for touchdesigner.

## PRESETS NOTES:
Preset 6 & 7 differ by the way the rotary encoder display their info ( pan vs dot mode ) and preset 6 use relative encoding whereas preset 7 use absolute encoding.

Preset 10 to 12 differ just by the faders channels, so one can control more than 8 fader in resolume by changing presets on the controller.


## THANKS
